A POC for an API management layer for Fourth.

Consists of two main parts:

1. A proxy layer that forwards requests to one more more configured
   endpoints. Upon this features such as rate limiting and and metrics
   gathering can be built.
2. A dashboard (and API) to manage the configuration of the proxy layer.
